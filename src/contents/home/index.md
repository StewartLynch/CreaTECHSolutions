# Welcome to CreaTECH Solutions

CreaTECH Solutions is Stewart Lynch's company.  It was established as a sole proprietorship in the 90's when Stewart was doing consulting work for FirstClass/OpenText while holding down a full time job as the Director of Technolog for the Richmond School District.<br/>It morphed into a demonstration site for FirstClass when Stewart joined the company in 2007 but in 2014, Stewart left OpenText and began to work entirely on creating iPhone/Mac and iPad applications.  <br/>Starting in 2020, Stewart started focussing on his YouTube channel where he now primarily creates videos to help others learn about Swift and SwiftUI application development.
